**Localframe** is a simple SwiftUI image generation app for iOS 26, powered entirely by Apple’s on-device Foundation Models via Image Playground. Designed for demonstration purposes, Localframe enables fast, private, and completely offline image creation — no internet connection or server required.

Localframe showcases how to integrate Apple’s [Image Playground framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/imageplayground) into a native iOS experience using SwiftUI and the new Foundation Models tools.

⚠️ **Disclaimer**: This app is for demonstration purposes only and is not production-ready. Output generated by the local image generation model may be inaccurate, incomplete, or misleading.

## ✨ Features

- 🖼️ **On-device Image Generation**: Uses Apple’s local Image Playground framework.
- 🔐 **Privacy-first**: All prompts and generated images stay on your device. No data is sent to the cloud.
- ⚡ **Fast & Offline**: Images are generated locally with no need for internet access.
- 🧑‍🎨 **Minimalist Prompt UI**: Clean SwiftUI interface for crafting prompts and viewing output.
- 🗑️ **No storage**: Generated images are not saved after closing the app.

## 🛠 Manual

- **Import the Library**: To work with [Foundation Models](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/imageplayground), you must import the library in every file where you intend to use them. Go with:

    ```swift
    import ImagePlayground
    ```

- **Create an ImageCreator object**: To start image creation, you need to create an [ImageCreator](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ImagePlayground/ImageCreator) object. In case of failure you will get an ```ImageCreator.Error```:

    ```swift
    do {
        try await self.imageCreator = ImageCreator()
    } catch {
        self.creatorError = error as? ImageCreator.Error
    }
    ```

- **Generate an Image**: To create images with the model, simply call the method and pass in your text prompt (as a ```String```) along with the desired style (as ```ImagePlaygroundStyle```).

    ```swift
    let images = imageCreator!.images(
        for: [.text(self.prompt)],
        style: self.generationStyle,
        limit: 2)
    ```

- **Save Images**: To display the generated images, store them in an array:

    ```swift
    for try await image in images {
        self.generatedImages = generatedImages + [image.cgImage]
    }
    ```
