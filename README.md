**Localframe** is a simple SwiftUI image generation app for iOS 26, powered entirely by Apple’s on-device Foundation Models via Image Playground. Designed for demonstration purposes, Localframe enables fast, private, and completely offline image creation — no internet connection or server required.

Localframe showcases how to integrate Apple’s [Image Playground framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/imageplayground) into a native iOS experience using SwiftUI and the new Foundation Models tools.
